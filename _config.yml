# All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
# Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
# however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.

# CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com) or http://username.github.io
#   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
#   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)

# GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.io/project-name)
#   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
#  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.io/project-name
#  - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
#  - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
#  - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
#  This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
BASE_PATH : false

# By default, the asset_path is automatically defined relative to BASE_PATH plus the
# enabled theme, i.e.: [BASE_PATH]/assets/themes/[THEME-NAME]
# Override this by defining an absolute path to assets here, e.g.:
#  http://s3.amazonaws.com/yoursite/themes/watermelon/assets
# THIS IS A HACK! (BP)
ASSET_PATH : /assets/themes/unify/

# These paths are to the main pages Jekyll-Bootstrap ships with.
# Some JB helpers refer to these paths; change them here if needed.
