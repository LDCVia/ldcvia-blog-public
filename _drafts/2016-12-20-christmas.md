And so another year draws to a close. We would like to take the opportunity to wish all our clients, business partners, friends, diligent beta testers and other supporters a very happy holiday season.

The four of us are looking forward to spending some time with loved ones after a year that can only be described as somewhat frantic (in a good way). In addition to a lot of consulting and coding work, commercially, 2016 looked like this (expressed in a smattering of bullet points):

* [We attended IBM Connect in Florida](/2016/01/26/see-us-at-connect)
* [We urged all coders to develop with LDC Via in a webinar](/2016/04/18/developing-apps)
* [We provided free full-text for all!](/2016/04/26/free-full-text-for-all)
* We headed to Eindhoven for Engage, to Austin for MWLUG, to London for ICON UK, and to Oslo for the ISBG meeting
* We announced a [strategic partnership with PSC Group](/2016/08/18/psc-group-ldc-via-partnership)
* [Launch KEEP.WORKS](/2016/08/24/announcing-keep-works)
* We attained [G-Cloud accreditation](/2016/08/18/g-cloud) for UK public sector work
* We added myriad features to the LDC Via platform: [Eton Mess](/2016/06/08/eton-mess), free full-text, [SAML](/2016/07/11/ldc-via-saml), [various API changes](/2016/07/18/api-changes), [Toad in the hole](/2016/08/31/toad-in-the-hole) and more&hellip;
* We announced another partnership, this time with [Andrew Magerman in Switzerland](/2016/12/06/swiss-ldc-via)

Phew! Thank you for reading, and we hope you have a restful break. We also look forward to working with many of you in 2017.
