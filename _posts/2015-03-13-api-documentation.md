… it’s interesting! Well, useful. We promise.

Here at LDC Via Towers we’re all developers, and a large portion of our lives is spent working with badly documented APIs. We’ve just created our own API for you to work with your LDC Via data and we wanted to make sure that it’s as painless for you as possible. Enter the &lt;trumpets sound&gt; [LDC Via API Documentation site](http://api.ldcvia.com) &lt;/trumpets fade&gt;.

The high-water mark of API documentation, in our opinion, is from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) and you’ll see that our site is very similar in structure. Our API site is very much a living document. A lot of our time currently is spent using our own API. When we spot things that are confusing or incomplete, we fix them. But as always, if you have any suggestions please let us know using the “Ask Us” link to the side of this post (and indeed on most other LDC Via pages).

Of course, we didn’t develop the site ourselves, we”re too busy writing our own code. Instead we used the wonderful [Slate project from Tripit](https://github.com/tripit/slate).
