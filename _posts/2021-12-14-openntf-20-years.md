[OpenNTF](https://openntf.org) is twenty years old today, can you believe that? For the die-hard Domino fans out there, you may well have seen an excellent video tribute to OpenNTF, which is really well put-together – hopefully it will go public at some point.

We were especially moved at the hat-tip to <a href="https://www.openntf.org/main.nsf/blog.xsp?permaLink=CGUN-BZZ7F6" title="Link to Christian Guedemann’s post on OpenNTF, “R.I.P. Nathan”">NTF himself</a> at the very beginning.

OpenNTF was a huge catalyst for change and positivity within the IBM Lotus world back in the day. In addition to its fantastic templates and code, from which we all benefitted hugely, OpenNTF helped build lasting business relationships and deep friendships. We at LDC Via consider ourselves immensely fortunate to have been involved with this most excellent community.

Thank you [Bruce](https://bruceelgort.com) and Nathan.
