[Whilst we sponsored Engage](https://engage.ug/engage2.nsf/Pages/sponsors2019) this year, it was a slightly muted affair for LDC Via, as only one of the motley crew made it to the conference, alas. [Theo](http://www.xceed.be) and Hilde put on an excellent show at a stunning excellent venue: [Autoworld](https://www.autoworld.be/the-museum-building), set in the beautiful _Parc Du Cinquantenaire_ (<abbr title="Also Known As">AKA</abbr> Jubelpark) in Brussels. Thank you Theo, you did it again!

Our diminution in numbers meant that we couldn’t run a stand this time round. Whilst that was a little disappointing, it did mean that for the first time in years, I could attend some sessions! The opening keynotes were interesting and well-presented: HCL and IBM both have a plan, and even some marketing! I particularly enjoyed the new format speed-sponsoring, ably wrangled by Mr. Tony Holder (and that has nothing to do with the fact that I won some beer. Cough).

From our perspective as a services organisation, it’s interesting to see other companies present their _products_. ISW’s commercial session on [Kudos Boards](https://info.kudosboards.com) was very good indeed; they’ve done a cracking job implementing this useful tool, and there are some interesting features in the pipeline too. Recommended!

Sadly we missed [our friend Andrew](https://blog.magerman.com) with his session on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) in favour of a <abbr title="Domino Query Language">DQL</abbr> presentation from [Tim Davis](https://www.turtlepartnership.com), but at least we can [read the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AndrewMagerman/engage-2019-software-documentation-is-fun-if-you-have-the-right-tools-introducing-sphinx) eh! (_Danke für die Schokolade mein Freund!_)

_Update_: here’s a link to [Tim’s presentation on DQL](http://turtleblog.info/2019/05/21/domino-query-language-engage/).

In other news, hell froze over: I attended an administrators session… But not just any session, oh no! [Gab](https://www.turtlepartnership.com) ran through [60 Admin Tips in 60 Minutes](https://www.slideshare.net/gabturtle/60-admin-tips) which was fantastic, and sure to be useful as I flail around in the console.

Until next year.
