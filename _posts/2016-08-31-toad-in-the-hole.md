We are delighted to announce the availability of our ‘Toad In The Hole’ release, hot on the heels of ‘Eton Mess’ back in June. It’s been almost two years since we released LDC Via, and the code keeps coming!

Whilst this release offers a number of significant improvements and additions (including a brand new comprehensive API documentation site no less), the headline for Toad In The Hole is search: specifically, “domain search” and the ability to do things like use regular expressions (!).

For the full low-down, be sure to read our exquisitely-drivelled [release notes](https://ldcvia.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/211921725-New-release-Toad-In-The-Hole-1-0-20160824-), and as always, please do get in touch if you want to know more.
