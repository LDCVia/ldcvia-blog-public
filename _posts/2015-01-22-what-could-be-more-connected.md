We were scratching our heads and twirling our moustaches at [LDC Via Towers](http://ldcvia.com), wondering what we could do as a bit of fun for ConnectED next week.

And then the penny dropped: what could be more “ConnectED” than … a competition crossword?! At what seems (no official word, but we all know it is don’t we?) to be our last January visit to the Swan & Dolphin, and *possibly* (perhaps IBM will tell us next week) the last conference recognisable as the “Lotusphere” we know and love, we decided to create a little bit of fun to fill in the dull moments (as if!) and test your knowledge of Lotus, Lotusphere and IBM. And, yes, we’re freely using the ‘L’ word, without embarrassment, because this is an unashamedly nostalgic effort, looking back affectionately on our collective journey down the years with the softwareformerlyknownasLotusNotes and its stablemates from Lotus and IBM.

You may have noticed that this is a ‘competition’ crossword. Yes, there will be a prize: a [Sonos Play:1](http://www.sonos.com/shop/products/play1). If you’re not a Sonos user already, you will love it. And if you are a Sonos user already, you will love it.

In the next post we’ll outline the rules for the competition, and reveal the crossword itself.

Meanwhile here, as a little teaser, is the crossword grid.
