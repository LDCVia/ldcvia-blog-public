It’s here, Engage is upon us! Our very own Woowar will be representing LDC Via this year, at the [Engage event](https://engage.ug) in Arnhem, at Burgers Zoo.

Do seek out Julian, and by all means have a chat – especially if you want to talk about application development services (node, Domino, .NET, Java, Google G Suite, etc.) or [application and data migration](http://ldcvia.com/downloads.html). We deal with platforms like Microsoft SharePoint, IBM Quickr, HCL Domino, IBM Connections and more…

Have a great conference!
