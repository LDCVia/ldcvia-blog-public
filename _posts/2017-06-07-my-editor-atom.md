_The first in an occasional series looking at the tools we use in our day-to-day work_

A lot has been said, written, and ranted, about programming editors and <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>s over the years. Allow us to add to the noise.

Mr. Poole is kicking off with a brief post about his code editor of choice, [Atom](https://atom.io)&hellip;

If you haven’t yet ventured into the world of this “hackable text editor for the 21st century” (their words), then it might be worth a go. Atom is an extremely usable, responsive, and distraction-free editor for code, and I’ve used it to the exclusion of all others for my text editing, JavaScript / web coding, bash scripting, and even the odd bit of Java ([IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is still my IDE of choice for more heavyweight Java programming and testing).

Why Atom? Well yes it’s open-source, free of cost, and has a massive [developer-friendly organisation behind it](https://github.com). That’s a cracking start, but the fact that Atom is built on top of tried-n-tested web technology ([Electron](https://electron.atom.io)) is the real clincher. If you don’t like something in the editor, all it takes is Ctrl-Shift-i (Windows) or Cmd-Opt-i (Mac) and you will have a familiar inspection pane at your disposal, a means for tweaking whatever it is that gets on your pip.

Atom ships with a number of key packages, not least the very wonderful [Autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus), and there are hundreds more to choose from. [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) is a must for navigating larger files, and the various [Linter](https://github.com/steelbrain/linter) packages are indispensable too. Here are a few others I recommend:

* [Semantic Colo(ur)](http://atom.io/packages/semanticolor) for sensible syntax colouring
* [atom-ternjs](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ternjs): “JavaScript code intelligence” which sits on top of the core Autocomplete-plus package
* [linter-eslint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) fronts up [ESLint](http://eslint.org) for Atom and Linter.
* [Todo-show](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show) Shows up all `TODO`, `FIXME` and related tasks in a project or whole workspace.

We don’t all agree about programming editors at LDC Via Towers: what are your favourites?
