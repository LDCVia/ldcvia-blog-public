Software developers are always seeking to take advantage of the best of new approaches, tools, techniques and languages. Many come and go, but some have a lengthy lifespan. Domino’s built-in languages of @Formula and LotusScript are pretty obscure these days, mainly because they only exist in the Domino world. Yes, Domino has Java too, but even with that there are some hoops to jump through and some non-standard techniques to grapple with.

Modern environments, in particular the <abbr title="MongoDB Express AngularJS Node.js">MEAN</abbr> stack, are taking over as mainstream and very popular tools. Why not take advantage of these skills and opportunities? Moving your Domino data to LDC Via will open it up to all these new worlds, and grant access to a new generation of developers.

Tell us what your organisation’s development strategy is: if we don’t already have sample code for you, we’ll write some.

(And if you’re writing your own apps for Via, don’t forget our [API documentation!](http://api.ldcvia.com/))
