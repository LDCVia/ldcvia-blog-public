Last week Julian was pleased to be asked to speak at the autumn [ISBG](http://www.isbg.org) conference in Oslo. The topic was ‘Finding your way out of the Domino maze’, a wide-ranging overview of the challenges that need to be overcome when migrating applications away from Domino, the meanings that ‘Migration’ could have, some of the key technologies to look at including [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL), and a brief overview of how LDC Via fits into that picture.
