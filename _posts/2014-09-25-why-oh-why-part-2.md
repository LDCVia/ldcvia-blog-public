In [part one of these posts](/2014/09/25/why-oh-why-part-1/) we took a look at why we created Via. In this post let’s explore what that means for you.

First, let’s revisit what Via is, in a nutshell:

* A modern hugely-scalable and highly-performant database platform
* A secure application layer that gives you all the Readers / Authors / Roles / Groups goodness you’ve come to love in Domino
* A set of tools to migrate Domino data into Via

Sound good? So where does that fit in your plans? Here’s where we see Via as a viable (see what we did there?) future for your Notes and Domino databases:
* Re-homing historical data from servers that are being retired
* Archiving data from Notes/Domino applications that have grown too large for Domino
* Integrating Domino-based data with other applications
* Selectively making Domino-based data available outside the firewall without exposing your Domino infrastructure
* Migration of Domino applications to the MEAN stack for increased interoperability and performance
* Exposing 'Lotus Notes’ application data to non-Notes client (e.g. web and mobile)

The list is endless. Well, long anyway.

The NSF data structure is a truly excellent piece of software engineering for its time. And it was way ahead of its time. But the rest of the world has finally caught up and, arguably, overtaken. Except in the area of security, where NSF’s Readers / Authors security model is still unique in its power and elegance. Or, at least, it was until now: LDC Via.
