One of the main uses for LDC Via is in re-homing historical data from servers that are being retired.

Your organisation may find itself in the situation where it is maintaining, supporting, and backing up Domino infrastructure purely so that the user can reference historical data held thereon — no new development, no real activity, few if any data updates … but you still need to “keep the lights on”. 

Even worse — and the longer you carry on the more likely this is — these servers may be poorly-supported, may not have robust back-up, and can even be running out-dated or un-patched infrastructure. 

So why not kick those boxes into touch and serve up your data in a modern, cost-effective manner (with support, and reliable backups)?
