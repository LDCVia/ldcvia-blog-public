Last week we attended MWLUG 2015 in Atlanta. It was our first US event and we had a great time. So thanks if you came along to the stand to chat or if you completed our word search competition.

Richard and the team did a great job organising a great venue, superb sessions and an all round excellent event.

The winner of our Sonos Play:1 draw for people who completed the word search was Michael Smith.
