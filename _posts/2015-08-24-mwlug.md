Last week we attended MWLUG 2015 in Atlanta. It was our first US event and we had a great time. So thanks if you came along to the stand to chat or if you completed our word search competition.

Richard and the team did a great job organising a great venue, superb sessions and an all round excellent event. We certainly hope to see you all again in Austin next year.

The winner of our Sonos Play:1 draw for people who completed the word search was Michael Smith.

Matt also presented a session about node.js for Domino developers, you can view the slides for that session at [his site](http://mattwhite.me/presentations).
