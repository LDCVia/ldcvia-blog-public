Back in January we hosted a webinar where we talked about the basics of LDC Via: how to migrate data and use our templates. If you wish to refresh your memory, that’s available up on YouTube: [LDC Via Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FVKgVzKxOM).

Time marches on, and we wanted to put together a second webinar, this time focusing on **developers**!

Two weeks ago we ran this, *Developing web applications with LDC Via*, which was loosely-based on some content we first presented at Engage this year. The session was popular, but a lot of people still missed it, and we had some audio issues too. As a result, we repeated the session last Wednesday, and the recording is available on our YouTube channel:

[Developing web applications with LDC Via](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es0PHt-nn8w).

During this session we talk about modern web application development using <abbr title="REpresentational State Transfer">REST</abbr> services. There are demonstrations from both the client- and server-side:  [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for some client code consuming the LDC Via <abbr title="Application programming Interface">API</abbr>, and also the Java framework [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com) on the server, together with a [node.js / Express application](http://expressjs.com) too.

Take a look at the session—there’s a lot of content in there—and if you want to dive into LDC Via [you can review API documentation on-line](http://api.ldcvia.com), and we have plenty of sample code in [our GitHub repository](http://github.com/ldcvia).
