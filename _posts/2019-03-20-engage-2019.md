We are happy to announce that once again [we have signed up as sponsors](https://engage.ug/engage2.nsf/Pages/sponsors2019) for the Engage user group conference in Brussels this year.

We have no idea whether — or how — we will get there, given the Brexit nonsense back here in Blighty, but we will try our best!

As a services organisation rather than “product vendors”, we feel it’s simpler just to attend and catch up with people, so we won’t be running a stand this time round.

The Engage conference takes place this year at [Autoworld](https://www.autoworld.be/the-museum-building), which looks amazing. As ever, Theo chooses the most splendid venues.

Look forward to seeing you in May: come and find us, let’s talk!
