Over the years books have been written, blog posts too, all about that mythical “work-life balance” thing, and how one maintains an even keel whilst delivering on ever-growing deadlines and requirements.

This is another post about that kind of thing. Sixteen-odd years ago, I think I speak for all of m’colleagues when I say that we were all churning out applications, documentation and generally splendid things for our corporate overlords at a rate of knots. And we did so without pulling many over-nighters. How? Well, I think it comes down to some simple, no-nonsense productivity tips which build on [our post about “getting started”](/2017/06/02/getting-started):

## Restrict yourself
There are 35 - 40 working hours in a week (unless you’re [Mark](http://wwww.stickfight.co.uk)). Cnsider reducing that number to 32 — for example, working four eight hour days _and then stopping_. This really focusses the mind. Funnily enough, when you hurl days, nights and weekends at something, you don’t necessarily get things done any quicker. An hour of laser-sharp focus trumps a day of faffing at the keyboard every time.

## Keep it simple
I’ve run a company for a decade now, and since the start have used this baroque piece of accounting software that did everything: payroll, stock… all sorts. Didn’t need 80% of it. Recently I switched to a multi-tab spreadsheet for my accounts instead. Financial stuff gets done in a fraction of the time it took me to plug in my numbers before, and my VAT return details just fall out too: wonderful!

A spreadsheet — no apps, no monthly cloudy subscriptions — just one file for one job.

## Plan away from the screen
It’s so easy to sit down at [your editor of choice](/tags#ide-ref) and hack away. Given that many of us are stationery geeks, why not simply grab a favourite pen and notebook, really think about what it is you want to do, and**plan**. When you reckon you’ve done enough thinking and planning, you probably haven’t. Ponder, gaze out of the window, go for a walk, and after all that write down some more. **Then** sit at your screen and get your work done.
