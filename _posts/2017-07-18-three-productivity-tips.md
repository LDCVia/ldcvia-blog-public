Over the years books have been written, blog posts too, all about that mythical “work-life balance” thing, and how one maintains an even keel whilst delivering on ever-growing deadlines and requirements.

This is another post about that kind of thing. Sixteen-odd years ago, I think I speak for all of m’colleagues when I say that we were all churning out applications, documentation and generally splendid things for our corporate overlords at a rate of knots. And we did so without pulling many over-nighters. What was the secret? Let me lay out some productivity tips to build on [(our post about “getting started”](/2017/06/02/getting-started) from a few weeks back:

## Restrict yourself
There are 35 - 40 working hours in a week (unless you’re [Mark](http://wwww.stickfight.co.uk)), consider reducing that number to 32 — for example, working four eight hour days _and then stopping_.

## Keep it simple
I’ve run a company for a decade now, and since the start have used this baroque piece of accounting software that did everything: payroll, stock, the lot. Meh.

A couple of months ago I switched to a multi-tab spreadsheet for my accounts instead. Now I just get financial stuff done in a fraction of the time it took me to plug in my numbers before (my VAT return details just fall out too: wonderful!). Just a spreadsheet. No apps, no monthly cloudy subscriptions, just an app.

## Plan away from the screen
It’s so easy to sit down at [your editor of choice](/tags#ide-ref) and just hack away. Many of us are stationery geeks. Grab a favourite pen and a nice notebook, and really think about what it is you want to do. When you think you’ve done enough thinking and planning, you probably haven’t. Do some more. Ponder. Look out of the window, go for a walk. And then plan some more. **Then** sit down at your screen and get your work done.
