The LDC Via team will be out in force at this year's IBM Connect event and, as in previous years, a couple of us are presenting.

[Mark Myers](http://stickfight.co.uk) is presenting a session with [Gabriella Davis](http://turtleblog.info/) about SSL and SHA2 Certificates:

**The SSL Problem and How to Deploy SHA2 Certificates**

*Monday 11:30-12:30 | Lake Eola A*

Two years ago enabling your site with SSL was a simple affair, buy a certificate or create your own, install it, then just remember to renew it every couple of years. Then, suddenly security holes are being found in SSL virtually every month , popular browsers stop connecting to your site to protect themselves, and you’re continually being told your users data is at risk. In this session we will discuss how it all went wrong and can go wrong again, then go through each step of requesting, generating and deploying a 4096 SHA-2 certificate to use in a keyfile by Domino, IBM Connections, IBM Sametime and other WebSphere products. If you work with these IBM products and need to secure them with confidence this session will show you how!

[Matt White](http://mattwhite.me) will be presenting a quickfire session about node.js:

**node.js for Domino Developers**

*Tuesday 10:30-11:00 | Solution EXPO Theater*

The world of web application development is big, really big. One of the most popular platforms is node.js. XPages developers already have a leg up in understanding node.js and in this session you'll find out the basics: how to create a basic web application. But then we'll push it a little bit further; how to integrate an application with your Domino data. We'll cover the best development tools and some useful tips and tricks to help on your journey to become a node.js developer.

And of course we’re keen to talk to people about [LDC Via](http://ldcvia.com) , so if you’d like to arrange a meeting you can do that [here](https://ldcvia.youcanbook.me/).
