We are delighted to announce the availability of our ‘Eton Mess’ release, as of Wednesday 8th June, nearly two years to the day since we first started creating LDC Via.

In case you’re wondering about the curious naming of our releases, we’ll let you into that secret in a separate blog post. Instead, for now let’s concentrate on a couple of the big headlines from this release.

Performance: the API now allows arrays of multiple documents to be ‘put’ in one call. This allows for much more efficient and performant applications.

Account limits: we have increased the account limits across all (well, all but one) of our tiers. The pricing has been tweaked too, to match. Overall, the new structure seems to fit our customers’ needs better, and that’s what it’s all about.

For a full list of all the lovely goodies we’re sending your way in this release, take a look at our hand-crafted artisanal [release notes](https://ldcvia.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/208944465-New-release-Eton-Mess-1-0-20160607-).
