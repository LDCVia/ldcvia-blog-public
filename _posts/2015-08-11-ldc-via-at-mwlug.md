This year [MWLUG](http://mwlug.com) comes from Atlanta, GA, promising over forty sessions and workshops on collaboration.

LDC Via will be there! Visit our stand and find out about our latest release, our new offering [LDC Via Lens](/2015-06-15-ldc-via-lens/), and our forthcoming developer community, #DevHub.

[Dev Hub](http://ldcvia.com/developers.html) is a new developer zone coming to LDC Via. This features integrated search with our technical documentation, highlighted blog posts and other information aimed at developers. As a developer you can also sign up for a free LDC Via account using just your email address, and play with the LDC Via API.

So if you’re attending MWLUG, come along to the stand, and we can tell you more!
