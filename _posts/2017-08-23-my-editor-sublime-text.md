_The fourth and final post in an occasional series looking at each of our preferred code editors._

A lot has been said, written, and ranted, about programming editors and <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>s over the years. Allow us to add to the noise.

It’s Julian’s turn to finish this series by talking about his choice, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)…

Before I dive into my choice, let’s have a quick recap of my colleagues’ well-considered picks.

[Ben works in Atom](/2017/06/07/my-editor-atom). He likes it because it’s clean, flexible, open-source, free, built on top of Electron, and has a huge variety of packages available to allow him to tailor it to his preferences and needs.

[Matt works in Visual Studio Code](/2017/06/15/my-editor-vscode). Despite the “Visual Studio” name, this is a lightweight editor, which he now prefers to Atom, not least for its top-notch integration with things like Git. Like Atom, it’s built on [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) and has a good selection of plug-ins to allow him to customise it.

[Mark works in WebStorm](/2017/06/20/my-editor-webstorm). This is the lightweight companion product to [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), which he likes for its approach to source code control, amongst other things.

As for me, I work in Sublime Text. Why? Because [a] it’s installed and [b] I’m lazy.
