Some - but not all - of the clues rely on some word play. So, for example, if the clue were “Accelerated, without Ecstasy” that can be pulled apart as

* a word meaning something similar to ‘accelerated'
* but with an ‘e’ removed (‘E’ being a common abbreviation of the drug name Ecstasy’)

So the answer there would, of course, be “Quickr”.

There you go. A little insight into the devious minds of the crossword compilers. Hope it helps.
