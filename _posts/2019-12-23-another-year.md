It’s that time again, Christmas and the end of another year! Where do the days go… A year of extreme busy-ness at LDC Towers, we had lots of work on, and also a wedding! This all leads to general blog neglect. Shame on us.

[Our venerable platform](http://ldcvia.com/howdoesitwork.html) is happily serving up a multi-tenant web application for a big client, with more back-end changes afoot. [Google apps script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) projects still abound, as do projects built using [node](https://nodejs.org). We’re still engaged with enterprise-scale migration projects, and we look after organisations from schools to insurance companies, finance outfits to consultancies. As ever, if you’re looking for assistance with your projects, by all means [get in touch](mailto:info@ldcvia.com?subject=Website%20query)!

In March 2020, [Engage 2020](https://engage.ug/) comes to Arnhem, and I’m sure we will be there in some shape or form – have you [registered yet?](https://engage.ug/engage2.nsf/Pages/attend2020order)

For now, we wish you a peaceful, merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a splendid new year!
