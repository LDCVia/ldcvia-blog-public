In just a few weeks we’ll be at this year’s [Engage event](https://engage.ug) in Rotterdam: we’re so looking forward to it. Every year Theo, Hilde and team put together an excellent event in the most amazing venues. This year is no different: Engage takes place on water — the [SS Rotterdam](http://ssrotterdam.com/) to be specific.

We love sponsoring Engage — in recent years it’s become our main conference — and as ever we’d be delighted to talk to you. Do pop by and see us: we’ll be near the the entrance to the product showcase, at stand #3. We also have some rather nifty give-aways this year, so [keep an eye on our Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/ldcvia).
