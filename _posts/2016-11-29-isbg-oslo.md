Our very own Julian Woodward will be presenting at the [ISBG meeting](http://www.isbg.org/) in Oslo this week. You can read more about his session at the relevant agenda page, if your Norwegian is up to scratch!

[Julian Woodward, Finding your way out of the Domino maze](http://www.isbg.org/lsbg/cms.nsf/$all/A3870EB2B3C95056C125807800783B24?Open)

In English:

## Finding your way out of the Domino maze - LDC Via
_Migrating applications away from Domino is a complex problem, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. In this session Julian Woodward will look at how to scope and plan a migration, examine the technical and human challenges youâ€™ll need to overcome along the way, and compare some of the approaches you can take._
