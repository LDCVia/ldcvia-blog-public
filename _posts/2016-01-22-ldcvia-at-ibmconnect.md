A week today people from all over the world will be beginning the annual trek to Florida. A new venue, but the same community and great content in sessions.

As always, the LDC Via team will be attending [IBM Connect](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/collaboration/events/connect/index.html). Matt, Mark, Ben and Julian will *all* be there.

To make it easier to get hold of us, weâ€™ve decided to put ourselves at your mercy and open up our diaries.

If you would like to talk about [LDC Via](http://ldcvia.com), see it in action or discuss the technology, simply book a meeting with us using this natty site: [https://ldcvia.youcanbook.me/](https://ldcvia.youcanbook.me/)
