In all the general busy-ness, coding, designing and earning a living, we’re conscious that there are lots of things to tell you!
2016 has been an extremely busy year for LDC Via: in addition to the technical challenges to overcome, and the new products to launch (more on [KEEP.WORKS](http://keep.works) in a separate post), there are meetings, proposals, partnerships to forge…

It is of the latter we wish to speak today. Some months ago, we opened discussions with our good friend [Andrew Magerman](http://www.magerman.com/en/Homepage.html), and these quickly bore fruit: [Swiss LDC Via](http://ch.ldcvia.com).

As many cloud aficionados are aware, hosting data outside national borders can be a massive issue for Swiss organisations – especially local and national government – and this is where Via hosted in Switzerland comes in. We invite you to explore the service and read more about it at Andrew’s site: [Host your migrated Domino Data in Switzerland at ch.ldcvia.com](https://blog.magerman.com/2016/11/14/host-your-migrated-domino-data-in-switzerland-at-ch-ldcvia-com/).
