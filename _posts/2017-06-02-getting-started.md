As new projects get underway, and existing code is refreshed and refined at LDC Towers, the idea of “getting started”, and its associated nasties (general procrastination, Googling, reading the news, making coffee…) is always uppermost in the mind.

Last month Ben posted about this, in a piece entitled [Time well spent](http://benpoole.com/weblog/201705061300), which covers the [Time Well Spent](http://www.timewellspent.io/) movement.

We’d like to continue examining this theme (there’s code to design you see), so how do you get going? Where to start with a blank screen before you? The task can often seem insurmountable.

Happily, the solution is really very simple: the best thing to do is _just start_. Take steps, and before you know it, you’ve got somewhere. This is covered in the blog post [Starting with failure is good for creativity, as long as you get started](https://qz.com/424461/the-three-most-destructive-words-in-the-english-language/), which is well worth a read, and examines [Kevin Ashton’s essay, <cite>How to Fly a Horse</cite>](http://www.howtoflyahorse.com). We especially like this bit:

>Good writing is bad writing well edited; a good hypothesis is whatever is left after many experiments fail; good cooking is the result of choosing, chopping, skinning, shelling, and reducing; a great movie has as much to do with what ends up on the cutting room floor as what does not.

… it echoes [that maxim from the late Steve Jobs](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt):

>Real artists ship

Don’t try to make things perfect. Just make things.
