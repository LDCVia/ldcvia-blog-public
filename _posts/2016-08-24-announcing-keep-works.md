Today we are announcing a brand new product: KEEP.WORKS.

![KEEP.WORKS logo](https://keep.works/images/logo-256.png "KEEP.WORKS logo")

[KEEP.WORKS](https://keep.works/) lowers the barrier for migrating IBM Notes and Domino data to a modern cloud platform. For a very small monthly fee, an individual or a small team can upload an NSF file, and have it converted automatically and available on desktop and mobile devices for them and any other users they care to invite. That’s really just the tip of the iceberg, and more details will follow.

But for now… we have a total of 12 places available on our invitation-only beta programme. If you’re interested in being one of the first people to put KEEP.WORKS through its paces, go to the [home page](https://keep.works/) and register, and we’ll be in touch when the beta programme opens in mid-September.
