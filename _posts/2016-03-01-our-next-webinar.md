Earlier in the year we hosted a webinar where we talked about the basics of LDC Via: how to migrate data and use our templates. You can watch that [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FVKgVzKxOM). But now it’s on to the next topic, and that is going to be developing applications using LDC Via as a back end.

We’re going to talk about modern web application development using REST services. So, we’ll show you demos of developing an application that works with LDC Via data using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), but then we’ll show you how to do exactly the same thing using node.js, and then the same again with Vaadin. We’re going to be talking fast, but hopefully you’re going to learn a lot.

So set the date in your diary: Wednesday April 6th at 4pm UK time. You can [sign up here](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/6357422784082605570).
