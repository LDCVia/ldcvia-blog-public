PSC Group and LDC Via have entered into a strategic partnership. Under this partnership PSC Group will adopt LDC Via as a platform for customers seeking to migrate data and applications away from legacy IBM (Lotus) Notes & Domino, and also as a preferred platform for the development of new software applications that might otherwise have been developed on Domino.

Why has PSC Group adopted LDC Via?

* Satisfy client needs for a low-risk migration strategy
* Create a modern application development platform
* Familiar REST-based API model
* Familiar security model for Domino applications
* Best-of-breed data migration tools

LDC Via provides a cloud-based managed database platform that emulates key features of IBM Domino in order to lower the barrier for transfer of both data and skills. The tiered monthly pricing model of LDC Via, with no minimum commitment, makes it a very cost-effective replacement for Domino. For larger customers bespoke pricing, dedicated installations, and on-premises options, are available: contact LDC Via for more details.

PSC Group is a global professional services and information technology consulting firm headquartered in Chicago.

LDC Via and PSC Group look forward to sharing more about our partnership and the application roadmap we are building together.
