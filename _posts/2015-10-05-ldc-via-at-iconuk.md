We were sponsors and exhibitors at [ICON UK](http://iconuk.org) this year, once again put together by the splendid [Tim Clark](http://tc-soft.com) and held at [IBM’s excellent London client centre](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/clientcenter/london/) on the South Bank.

We spoke at a well-attended sponsor session, in part showing off our new offering [LDC Via Lens](/2015-06-15-ldc-via-lens/), and had a number of excellent conversations with people. Thanks so much to everyone who dropped by and said hello!
ICON UK raised an amazing £5,000 for [The Rainbow Trust](http://rainbowtrust.org.uk) this year with attendee fees, a raffle and a gala night auction.

As always with these conferences, there were prizes to be had. Our closing session give-away was a Sonos Play:1, won by Rob Mason of [Redtable Information Solutions](http://redtable-is.com): well done Rob!
