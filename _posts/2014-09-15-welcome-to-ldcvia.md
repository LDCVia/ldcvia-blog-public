Welcome to a new offering from LDC. We call it LDC Via.

Over successive posts we'd like to introduce you to this new tool, designed to liberate your information from older IBM Domino (Lotus Notes) data stores.

Perhaps your organisation is moving away from Domino, or simply no longer investing in maintaining the platform. Maybe you have applications in need of an overhaul, or systems are being retired, but you want to retain your dataâ€¦

As the name suggests, LDC Via represents a path, a route away from Domino, whilst retaining the things you need: document-based data, name-, group- and role-based security, and more.

In short, Via brings delightfully simple access to your information, whether it's on premises or in the cloud.
