In just four weeks LDC Via will be heading to this year’s [Engage event](https://engage.ug). Over the years, Theo and his team have set themselves a high bar in terms of the quality of sessions and the amazing venues he finds. 2017 promises to be just as good as we have come to expect.

From an LDC Via point of view, we’re very happy to be sponsoring the event for the third year. We’d love for you to come and visit our stand to talk all things app dev, including application migration and modernisation. You’ll also have the chance to win one of our giveaways; we’re doing something a little different this year.

Of course, it wouldn’t be a User Group event without one of us speaking. This year, the honours fall to our resident Champion Mark Myers. He’ll be presenting a new session: “Choose your own adventure: Update/Convert/Replace” at 13:30 on Tuesday in Room C (Gorilla 3).
