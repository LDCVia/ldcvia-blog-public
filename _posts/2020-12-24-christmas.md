Well. 2020 eh? No, letâ€™s not go there. Instead, we should like to wish you all a
very happy holiday season.

The four of us are looking forward to spending some time with
([tier-reduced numbers of](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/23/millions-more-face-tier-4-covid-restrictions-in-england-from-boxing-day))
loved ones after a year that can only be described at various times as bizarre,

Merry Christmas, and a healthy, happier new year to you all.
