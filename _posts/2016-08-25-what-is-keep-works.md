Nearly two years ago we launched LDC Via, a new platform that allows you to migrate your legacy Notes and Domino data, and host it on our servers while retaining a lot of the best features of Lotus Notes. Over that time we’ve talked to a lot of people and, it’s fair to say, what we offer is a broad palette of tools: a migration utility, a database platform and a full featured API. But it can be a little overwhelming to get started.

Initially we created several templates that run on the main LDC Via servers. But they were really technical demonstrations at best. So, over the last few months, we’ve created a new service: [KEEP.WORKS](https://keep.works/).

[KEEP.WORKS](https://keep.works/) offers several things. Key among them is a simple migration path. You simply need to upload your legacy Notes database to our servers and we will convert it for you. This can be done in as little as ten minutes, depending on the size of your database. If your database matches one of our standard templates (Discussion, Document Library, Teamroom, Journal, Personal Address Book or Mail) then you can immediately log in and carry on working with your data.

To be honest, if that were all that KEEP.WORKS offered you might feel a little underwhelmed. Automated database migration is nice, but we want more! Well, how about a configuration driven way of continuing to work with your data? We’ve got it.

When you import a non-standard database, you can configure how to view, create and edit the data. You can even enable document-level security and set up additional users to access it. All without writing a single line of code.

And the nice thing about all this? Well it’s developed using LDC Via as the underlying platform, so if you outgrow the [KEEP.WORKS](https://keep.works/) platform your developers can continue to work with the data and create your own custom applications using whatever languages and coding tools you (or they!) choose. Or, if you prefer, we can create more complex custom applications for you.

For the first month of its life, [KEEP.WORKS](https://keep.works/) is going to run in an invitation-only beta status, with a strict limit of 12 places. If you’d like to be one of the first people to put KEEP.WORKS through its paces, visit the home page here: [https://keep.works/](https://keep.works) - alternatively, you’ll be able to sign up for a full account in just a couple of months time. 

And the price? Well we start at £20 per month!
