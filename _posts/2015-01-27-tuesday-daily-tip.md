Today, because this is the last ‘tip’ day and we’re feeling excessively generous, here are two final tips for you.

1. One of the clues may require a Google search (unless your general knowledge is outstandingly good).
2. And another may require a calculator (unless your mental arithmetic is outstandingly good).

If you want to have a go at the crossword, and you’ve not yet got a copy, track down [Ben Poole (@benpoole)](http://twitter.com/benpoole), [Mark Myers (@stickfight)](http://twitter.com/stickfight) or [Julian Woodward (@woowar)](http://twitter.com/woowar). And don’t plan on getting any sleep tonight if you want to win the prize.

See earlier blog entries for previous tips.
