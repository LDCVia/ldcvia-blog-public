We busy folks at [LDC Via](http://ldcvia.com) are hosting a webinar on January 12th which will introduce you to the LDC Via tool and platform. If you want to know what this stuff is all about, and see it in action, [you should sign up right away](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3901059929414555906).

Julian and Matt will be presenting the webinar itself, and Ben will be &#8220;back-room boy&#8221;, responding to any questions on-line and in the webinar chat.

We hope you can join us: we have had a fair bit of interest in LDC Via over the past few months, but equally a lot of people still ask us what it is all about. This session will answer those questions, and more!
