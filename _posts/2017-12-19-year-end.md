Here we are, almost at the end of another year, crikey. As is pretty much the norm, we’ve all been heads-down working frantically, and thus neglecting this poor blog. What’s new?

Well, we’re finishing up a large project using [our platform](http://ldcvia.com/howdoesitwork.html) to deliver a spanking new version of a multi-tenant web application. We’re also working on projects making use of [Google apps script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/), [node](https://nodejs.org), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and more, with Domino migration work underway too!

In other news, [Engage 2018](https://engage.ug/) is a go for LDC Via: we’ll be in Rotterdam, how about you?
