Hello 2018! A couple of weeks back we at LDC Via had our first board meeting of the year, and we’re thinking about what we’re going to do in 2018, what we’re going to concentrate on, and how we’re going to deliver our work.

The platform, together with our consulting base, had a pretty decent year in 2017 and as a result we are due some timely upgrades, both for LDC Via itself, and for the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) layer that underpins it. Busy busy busy!

The consultancy side of our work is growing far more than expected: to the point where we’re having to turn away work, which as any freelancer knows, is anathema. This growth in our consultancy practice has given us a couple of advantages:

1. Every migration we run increases our knowledge and gives us new ideas to improve the LDC platform and associated migration utility.
2. We get to see all the different stresses and strains that every company out there works with.

You might think that after a few migrations we would have seen them all, but no, every organisation brings its own story (and motivation) to the table. What is more, whilst we have a platform and a migration “story” to sell, a considerable amount of our work is focussed on bringing Domino-based data and knowledge into other platforms entirely: G Suite, Office 365, custom <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> and more… it’s never dull.

All work and no play make for a dull Via. Whilst of course it’s a conference, and it’s “work”, we do love to attend [Engage](https://engage.ug) every year. Come May, we shall be there in Rotterdam, as you will have seen from previous posts and [tweets](https://twitter.com/ldcvia), and we look forward to seeing you!
