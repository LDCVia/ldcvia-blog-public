We’ve [mentioned before](/2015/07/03/full-text-search/) how important we think full-text search is as a feature. Well, we’re happy to announce that _even free accounts_ can now make use of our full-text search functionality.

Once you’ve imported or created a database in Via, it’s simply a case of going to the Database Settings screen and ticking the “Indexed” check-box.

If you’re writing your own applications to access data in Via, then our [API documentation](http://api.ldcvia.com/#search-in-a-collection) is invaluable for putting together those powerful full-text queries.

Also, bear in mind that for maximum flexibility you can combine full-text queries with our pre-existing structured query syntax. Happy searching!
