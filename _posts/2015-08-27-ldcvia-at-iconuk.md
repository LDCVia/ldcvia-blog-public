This year, as with so many previous, [ICON UK](http://iconuk.org) will be running again. The dates are 21st and 22nd of September and the [agenda](http://iconuk.org/iconuk/iconuk2014.nsf/agenda.xsp) is looking really good.

LDC Via will be there! Visit our stand or come to our session at 2pm on the Monday. [Matt](http://mattwhite.me) will also be presenting a technical session about node.js for Domino developers at 4pm on Monday.

So if youâ€™re attending ICON UK, come along to the stand, and we can tell you more!
