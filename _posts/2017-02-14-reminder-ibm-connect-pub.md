Just a reminder that we are hosting a wee [IBM Connect goes to the pub](/2017/01/27-ibm-connect-goes-to-the-pub) event next week, and would love to see you in London for free beer, chat, and the IBM Connect <abbr title="Opening General Session">OGS</abbr>.

We’ve set up a [registration page here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ibm-connect-goes-to-the-pub-tickets-31535309961), just so that we know who’s going to come along. See you next week!
