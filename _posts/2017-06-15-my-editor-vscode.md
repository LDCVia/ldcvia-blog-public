_Continuing our series where we talk about our preferred code editor_
 
A lot has been said, written, and ranted, about programming editors and <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>s over the years. Allow us to add to the noise.
 
Itâ€™s Mattâ€™s turn this week to talk about his choice, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)&hellip;

Built on the same Electron framework as Mr Pooleâ€™s choice, VS Code is the first IDE Iâ€™ve actively chosen that is developed by Microsoft. Although it shares the Visual Studio moniker, itâ€™s a totally different beast to the full blown C# IDE that Windows developers use. This is a lightweight text editor with added bells and whistles.

I only switched over about six months ago from Atom, but Iâ€™ve found that itâ€™s made my dev experience far more flexible. From the tighter integration of Git, an integrated terminal window and many many plugins, there is everything I need for my daily node and Javascript development needs.
Like Atom, there are so many plugins. Some of my favourites areâ€¦

* [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) which tidies up code for you.
* [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker) for working with container-ising your application.
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) the almost required JavaScript linting utility.
* [JSON Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eriklynd.json-tools) useful utilities for working with JSON.

Iâ€™ve got others, but I feel like Iâ€™m going on a little too much about VS Code ðŸ˜ƒ

But I also thought it would be good to mention the other place I spend a lot of my time, and thatâ€™s Chrome. Just a plain install is great for the web developer, but once you add some extensions, it becomes truly useful.

The ones I canâ€™t live without areâ€¦
* 1Password - my password manager of choice
* Full Page Screen Capture - which takes a screenshot of a full web page even when itâ€™s too tall for the browser
* Browserstack - for testing different browsers
* React Developer Tools - React is my chosen front end framework these days and these tools are really useful
* EditThisCookie - cookies are a necessary evil of web development, this tool lets you manage them
* Show me the styles! - a relatively new addition to my suite, it lets you select an element on a page and shows you useful information about it

So these are some of my every day development tools. What are some of yours?
