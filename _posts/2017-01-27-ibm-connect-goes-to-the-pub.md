IBM Connect is moving home, and for the first time in many moons, the LDC Via team will not be attending. But that doesn’t mean we won't be paying attention.

We didn’t want to miss the OGS, and thought you might be interested in watching along with us. To that end, like Sham 69, [we’re going down the pub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM0Neo85Rj4) and we’d like you to join us, have a beer and maybe some chat about whatever gets announced.

We’ve set up a little [registration page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ibm-connect-goes-to-the-pub-tickets-31535309961), just so that we know who’s going to come along, we’d love to see you there.
