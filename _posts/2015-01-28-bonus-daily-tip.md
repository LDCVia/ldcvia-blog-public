Okay, we said we wouldn’t give any more tips, but we’re feeling especially nice today.

If a clue contains a word that might imply things being disassembled or assembled - for example “destroyed”, “in disarray”, “broken”, “rebuilt” - that probably means you’re looking for an anagram in the clue.

Now hurry up: you only have until midday today to get your solution to [Ben Poole (@benpoole)](http://twitter.com/benpoole), [Mark Myers (@stickfight)](http://twitter.com/stickfight) or [Julian Woodward (@woowar)](http://twitter.com/woowar)!

See earlier blog entries for previous tips.
