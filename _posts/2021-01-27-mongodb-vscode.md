A (very) belated happy new year to you! 2021 isn’t behaving so far, but we have
high(er) hopes, as I’m sure do you.

In the meantime, we do what we can, and what we can do is work with node,
MongoDB, and the rest of the happy gang. To that end, we were delighted when
[MongoDB introduced an integration for the VS Code editor](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/introducing-mongodb-for-vs-code),
and now they’ve gone and improved it! Specifically, one of the cracking new
features is the ability to update documents directly from VS Code. Splendid!

You can read more about the improvements in the official blog post,
[What’s new in MongoDB for VS Code](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/whats-new-in-mongodb-for-vs-code).
